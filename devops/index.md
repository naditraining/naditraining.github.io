### Week 5: CI/CD with Jenkins

- Freestyle and pipeline jobs (declarative syntax)
- **Hands-on**: Auto build and deploy from Git

### Week 6: Docker & Containerization

- docker basics
    - [**What is Containerization?](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/?_bhlid=2dd00407bd184499e60a572c566d23b12b0010ba&ref=learnxops.com)** â€“ How containers differ from virtual machines and why they are beneficial.
    - [**Docker Terminology**](https://docs.docker.com/contribute/style/terminology/?_bhlid=7082ac9c069a4de99cd8d686ba46198933695b49&ref=learnxops.com)â€“ Image (template), Container (running instance), Dockerfile, Docker Hub (image registry).
        - by default it uses the registry [docker.io](http://docker.io) which points to https://hub.docker.com/
        - you can mention customer registry while pulling images or docker file.
            
            ```
            docker pull [myregistry.example.com/myimage:tag](http://myregistry.example.com/myimage:tag)
            docker push [myregistry.example.com/myimage:tag](http://myregistry.example.com/myimage:tag)
            ```
            
        - note you need to login to custom registry using
        
        ```
        docker login myregistry.example.com
        
        ```
        
        - in k8s, they create item called secrets (custom registry details, username and password) and refer them in deployment file using parameter called imagePullSecrets.
        - in dockerfile, there is no direct login option, instead it uses the credentials saved in below path when building and pushing the image.
        
        ~/.docker/config.json
        
        - In jenkins, credentials stored in secrets or environment variables, and docker login will be performed before building and pushing image.
    - [**Docker Architecture**](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-overview/?_bhlid=1cccc5fb496f6d1ee23945533584d23053c9cfb7&ref=learnxops.com#docker-architecture)â€“ Understanding the client-server model, Docker Engine, and Docker Daemon.

        â†“
        runc (low-level runtime that does the actual Linux container isolation using namespaces and cgroups)`
        
    - [**Working with Containers](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/?_bhlid=d570e704b906d49461ff1e5630d8a2782a37a592&ref=learnxops.com)** â€“ Running, stopping, removing containers, mapping ports.

    - [**Building Docker Images](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/?_bhlid=aaa12433e8aaf7b08111fb77ddd0484bef8c8c92&ref=learnxops.com)** â€“ Writing Dockerfile, adding dependencies, and optimizing images.
        -
